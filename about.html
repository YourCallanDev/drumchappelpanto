  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <p>In 2022, Maggie Harkness-Smith had a brilliant idea for a Theatre Group and launched Pantozonians. The first show was Cinderella, which Maggie wrote and directed at the GoodYear Social Club in Drumchapel. Since then, the club has held various fundraising nights, from Bingo to Discos, etc. In 2023, the group name changed to Drumchapel Amateur Pantomime Group, and they performed The Wizard of Oz Pantomime, again written by Maggie. Maggie welcomes anyone with an interest in the performing arts to attend her group, with rehearsals taking place from April to December each year.</p>
